GLOBAL FEATURE IMPORTANCE INTERPRETATION

The SHAP summary analysis indicates that the model is most influenced by the following features:

1. Age  
   Higher age values strongly increase the likelihood of churn.

2. Balance  
   Customers with large account balances show higher churn probability.

3. Number of Products  
   Customers with only one product contribute positively to churn risk.

4. IsActiveMember  
   Inactive customers display consistently higher SHAP values toward churn.

5. Credit Score  
   Lower credit scores push predictions toward churn, while higher scores decrease risk.

Overall, the SHAP plot shows a clear separation in how customer behavior, financial attributes, and activity levels influence churn risk across the dataset.
